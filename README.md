# OWASP Pangloss

OWASP Pangloss is a [OWASP TOP10 2017](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10-2017_Top_10) sandbox made to help people learn the common security flaws of applications.

The name is inspired by the Pangloss character of Voltaire's novella [Candide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candide). 
Pangloss is Candide's teacher, and follows a Leibnizian mantra: "all is for the best" in the "best of all possible worlds".
